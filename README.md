## About the Project

This project leverages **StarCoder2-15B**, a large language model, and a custom **Tree-sitter-SQL** parser to automatically generate SQL code, instructions, and explanations.  
We designed a pipeline to automate and validate SQL code generation using **few-shot prompting** and **self-validation** techniques.

## Key Components

- **HF Token Setup** and Environment Configuration
- **Tree-sitter-SQL Parser** for tokenizing SQL code
- **Seed to Concept (Sâ†’C)** stage for extracting task concepts
- **Concept to Instruction (Câ†’I)** stage for generating natural language instructions
- **Instruction to Response (Iâ†’R)** stage for generating solutions
- **Few-shot Prompting** for SQL tasks
- **Self-Validation Scripts** to validate SQL responses

---

## How It Works

1. **Seed Gathering**  
   Extracted 100K SQL code snippets and prepared them for processing.

2. **Concept Extraction (Sâ†’C)**  
   Identified core tasks and keywords from the seed code.

3. **Instruction Generation (Câ†’I)**  
   Generated clear, human-readable instructions from extracted concepts.

4. **Response Generation (Iâ†’R)**  
   Generated SQL queries and explanations for each instruction.

5. **Self-Validation**  
   Automatically executed generated SQL to validate correctness.
